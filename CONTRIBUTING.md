Contributing
So you want to contribute to the project? How lovely! Here are a few things to keep in mind when working with the project:

Code Quality
The format of the code is handled by the use of Prettier and EsLint. When coding, make sure that your IDE has access to use Prettier and EsLint to format the code before committing the code to the repository.

Testing
This project is using itself for testing and the test specifications should be placed within the /test folder. All functionality should have it's use-cases somewhat thoroughly tested (best sentence ever, thank you very much).

Pull Requests
When you are done with your contribution, issue a pull request. The project maintainers will have a look at it as soon as possible!

Have fun
ðŸŽº This is the most important thing of all.
